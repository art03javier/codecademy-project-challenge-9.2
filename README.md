Challenge Project: Responsive Club Website

Project Goals
In this project, I’ll builded my own club group page that will dynamically respond as you adjust the size of the screen!​

This project demonstrate many of the responsive design tools I learned. 
The responsive design concepts are as follow;
1. Making images toggle to certain percentages in terms of width after a certain minimum screen size.
2. Using a @media rule to change page layout and behavior based on size breakpoints.
3. Employing responsive units em and rem to size and space elements with width and padding.
